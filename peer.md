# Comparison with Peer Programs

- other SE degree programs? how does ours compare?
    - RIT (the oldest)
       https://www.rit.edu/study/software-engineering-bs
       (3 coop terms required, accredited)
    - any other interesting ones?
    - are other universities basically sticking to:
        - SE is subset of CS
        - SE is subset of ECE
        - SE is not a degree program?
    - https://be.seas.upenn.edu/undergraduate/admissions/bas-or-bse-degree/

We have oodles more SE content than, well, CS programs, which usually
have one course, if that. PL has taken 0 SE courses in his life, and he didn't
graduate that early---1999.
