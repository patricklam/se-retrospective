Waterloo's Software Engineering Program: a 20-year retrospective

Twenty Years of Undergraduate Software Engineering at Waterloo

# Introduction

In this paper we want to discuss lessons that we have learned from 20 years of running the successful
Software Engineering undergraduate program at the University of Waterloo. Obviously curriculum evolution
is important. But we will first talk about meta-curricular issues: student support, governance,
collaboration, coop, and accdreditation.

# Historical Contextualization

- SE degree programs, including UW, were created out of an
  understanding of what SE was up to the 1990s.
- Has SE changed since then? What has happened?
    - metaphors of engineering, etc.
    - industry
    - education
    - profession / licensing
        - often regional
        - industry is global
- formal methods
- AI
- how has the existence of SE degree programs influenced history?
    - thoughts?
    - Software Engineer is certainly a prominent job title ...
- how has history influenced SE degree programs?
    - e.g., re-ordering SE1/2/3 from waterfall to agile
- surprises?
    - our graduates go to work at Facebook ... is that the critical
      civil infrastructure that we thought we were training people
      for?
    - voting machines?
    - Boeing 737 MAX
    - etc.
- other SE degree programs? how does ours compare?
    - RIT (the oldest)
    - any other interesting ones?
    - are other universities basically sticking to:
        - SE is subset of CS
        - SE is subset of ECE
        - SE is not a degree program?


# meta-curricular issues

* aCCreditation
* collaboration
* cohort
  + but no ordering between 3B, 4A, 4B
* coop

* sibling programs (NE, TRON, GeoE, BME)
* CS vs SE vs ECE

# student support

* first year midterm analysis
* https://patricklam.ca/post/20201212-se-student-support/

# thoughts about original design

* sharing already-existing courses
* 50/50 ECE/CS balance

* natural science

# things we discovered over 20 years (curricular evolution)

* SE 141 electrodeath
* RIP TPM
* RIP SE 362 Software Project Management
* RIP SE 457 System Performance Evolution
* + SE 350
* moving SE 1/2/3 to 3A/3B/4A: 
    * inversion of waterfall ordering to agile ordering
    * switched to testing, design, requirements
* electives/open electives
* CS 348 in 2B

* CS 137/138 (and programming experience)
* CS 247/SE 464 vs CS 446

* what electives do SE students take?
  resources/courses-taken-by-se-students.md
* transfers

# active curriculum issues

* physics
* feedback control (MATH 213 got added to support that since initial proposal)
* which version of fundamental math courses? how much fundamental math?
* SE 1/2/3 (we basically refactored the project into its own thing and gave a lot more flexibility)
* FYDP (could be its own paper, was not part of initial proposal but was added early)
* ideas clinic
* SE 101
* stats
* humanities/social impact, comms

* meets most BCS requirements
