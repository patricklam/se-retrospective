# Introduction

In this paper we want to discuss lessons that we have learned from 20 years of running the successful
Software Engineering undergraduate program at the University of Waterloo. Obviously curriculum evolution
is important. But we will first talk about meta-curricular issues: student support, governance,
collaboration, coop, and accreditation.



# History and Lessons

In this section we will explain why the SE program at Waterloo exists
and what we have learned since then. Both of these inform a discussion
of whether we would seek to create such a program today.

## The Beginning

In the mid-1990s, the then-Department (now a School) of Computer Science
at the University of Waterloo included three core Software Engineering faculty
and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering included the same number.
For context, each unit had about 40 faculty members.

## Beyond the SE Option

Undergraduate education in Software Engineering at Waterloo first
coalesced around an SE Option (comparable to a minor), first offered
in 1994. This program was mostly aimed at CS and Computer Engineering
(CE) students, and was jointly offered by CS and ECE with a core of
three Software Engineering courses:

* Software Requirements Specification and Analysis
* Software Design and Architecture
* Software Testing, Quality Assurance and Maintenance

We will reflect on this core below.

The SE core would build on a set of 8 core technical courses which are
essentially core undergraduate computer science (e.g. algorithms,
operating systems, etc) generally required of all CS and CE
undergraduate students, 3 software-intensive courses, and non-technical electives
in communications, societal issues, and business issues.

Four years later, in 1999, a committee proposed a dedicated Bachelor of
Software Engineering program at Waterloo, with the rationale that an option
wasn't big enough to encompass the field of software engineering. It is this
program that we discuss in this paper.

## Where the SE Undergrad Program fits in

The University of Waterloo offers three programs that are, broadly
speaking, in the software area: Computer Science, Software
Engineering, and Computer Engineering. While Software Engineering is a
large[sizes] program on the Canadian scale, it is small compared to both
Computer Science and Computer Engineering.  At undergraduate
recruitment events, by far the most-often-asked question is what is
the difference between these programs; we have printed business cards
with QR codes that link to longer descriptions of the differences.

We designed the program as a joint program. SE students belong to both
the Faculty of Mathematics and the Faculty of Engineering, and we say
that SE students are CS students and simultaneously belong to the ECE
department. In practice, they strongly identify with Engineering, yet
many students[CS] transfer to Computer Science. SE students satisfy
"CS students only" prerequisite requirements for course enrollment
purposes.

## The first 20 years

The first Software Engineering class, of 102 students, was admitted in
September 2001, and 80 of them graduated on schedule in June
2006. Since then, the program has produced 1315 graduates, with a
first-year admissions target of 125 students. The mean number of
first-year students over the 20-year history is also 124.1, but that
obscures the fact that the 2001--2010 average is 113 and the
2011--2021 average is 135.  The mean number of graduating-term
students is 85 across the 16 graduating classes to date. As of
February 2021, there are 582 students enrolled across all years.

In the same time period, CS has granted just under 6000 undergraduate
degrees, while ECE has granted 2000 undergraduate degrees.

# Surprises

- how has the existence of SE degree programs influenced history?
    - thoughts?
    - Software Engineer is certainly a prominent job title ...

- surprises?
    - our graduates go to work at Facebook ... is that the critical
      civil infrastructure that we thought we were training people
      for?
    - voting machines?
    - Boeing 737 MAX
    - etc.

## other SE

- other SE degree programs? how does ours compare?
    - RIT (the oldest)
       https://www.rit.edu/study/software-engineering-bs
       (3 coop terms required, accredited)
    - any other interesting ones?
    - are other universities basically sticking to:
        - SE is subset of CS
        - SE is subset of ECE
        - SE is not a degree program?

We have oodles more SE content than, well, CS programs, which usually
have one course, if that. PL has taken 0 SE courses in his life, and he didn't
graduate that early---1999.

* aCCreditation
  + ethics and professionalism (see professionalism.md)
* collaboration
* cohort
  + but no ordering between 3B, 4A, 4B
* coop

* sibling programs (NE, TRON, GeoE, BME)
