# Co-operative Education and Industry

At the University of Waterloo, "co-operative education" means that students
interleave academic terms with work terms. All engineering students,
including software engineering students, have 6 work terms interleaved
between their 8 academic terms. Students generally require 5 successful
work terms to graduate. Computer Science students are not required
to pursue co-operative education, but 72% of CS students graduating between
Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 graduated with co-op.

Exit survey results for the graduating SE class of 2019 emphasized
student satisfaction with co-op: out of 50 responses (of 92 graduates), 41 (82\%)
strongly agreed and 8 (16\%) weakly agreed with "The co-op portion of
my engineering undergraduate program has met my expectations". The remaining
response was a strong disagree.

Co-operative education is a major draw for our students, and we
believe that it is a key factor behind the calibre of student that we
are able to attrect.  Co-op's attractiveness is helped by the current
extremely healthy state of software engineering industry and the high salaries;
our placement rates are always above 95% and typically highest of all
of Waterloo Engineering's programs. The high salaries enable many
students to pay tuition and living costs; the student-run class survey
for the class of 2021 reported average hourly compensation from
C$21.48 for the first co-op term to C$60.36 in the sixth term. That
survey also reported that a plurality of respondents (40%) indicated
that California was their favourite co-op location, with 68% having a
favourite location in the United States.

Co-op drives student organizations: a major part of the Software Engineering 
Society's work is organizing résumé critiques and mock interviews, where senior
students advise junior students about how to get jobs. 

However, co-op comes with downsides as well. We have observed (and discourage!)
the "Cali or bust" phenomenon, where students desperately try to get a California
co-op job, believing that it is necessary to work in California to be a successful
SE student. Humans can be competitive, and we understand that our students judge
each other based on their co-op jobs (again, against our advice).

Further, to our knowledge, around 3% of our graduating class pursues a graduate
degree. Per our exit survey, almost all graduates go on to a full-time
software engineering job. As researchers, we would benefit from more of our
students continuing for a graduate degree.
