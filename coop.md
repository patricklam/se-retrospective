# Co-operative Education and Industry

At the University of Waterloo, "co-operative education" means that students
interleave academic terms with work terms. All engineering students,
including software engineering students, have 6 work terms scheduled
between their 8 academic terms, and generally require 5 successful
work terms to graduate. Computer Science students are not required
to pursue co-operative education, but 72% of students graduating between
Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 graduated with co-op.

Exit survey results for the graduating SE class of 2019 emphasized
student satisfaction with co-op: out of 50 responses (of 92 graduates), 41 (82\%)
strongly agreed and 8 (16\%) weakly agreed with "The co-op portion of
my engineering undergraduate program has met my expectations".

(discussion about how it is a major draw but limits
our potential to attract graduate students, student community based on
coop jobs, students striving to get the "best" coop job)
