Accreditation is a big pain in the ass, as we all know. I agree with many of the other thoughts. Here's my calculations. I have no sentimental attachment to being accredited and if we could offer a good program without accreditation then we should.

1. Accreditation forces us to have stuff in our curriculum that we don't want. There is no natural champion for, in particular, the NSEs.
2. Students have a strong identification with "engineering undergraduate culture" (e.g. EngSoc) even if many students do end up switching to CS especially after first year. Being iron ring eligible is important to some subset of our students.
3. SE has a distinct identity from CS, in a much stronger way than the SE option. To expand on what I said above, I think the principal drivers of that are the cohort system and the iron ring.
4. I don't think actual curriculum content is that important to students, and I think it doesn't strongly affect what graduates are able to do 5 years down the road. My assumption is that a graduate can learn what they need to in terms of technical skills. Heresy alert: I'm skeptical that SE 463/464/465 contribute significantly to our students designing and writing better systems later on. On the other hand, the mandatory 3-course FYDP sequence does, I think, cause many students to stretch themselves in ways that they wouldn't otherwise. 

We do talk about ethics perhaps a bit more than CS students get, but I also wouldn't put a lot of money on graduates internalizing engineers' responsibility to society. Well, I'd put $1000 on it, but I wouldn't put half a year's salary on it.

OK, so what if we had a cohorted program which had no iron ring? What would I tell people at OUF? Well, I could say the words about SE 463/464/465, but I wouldn't. I could say words about ECE 124 and ECE 222 and getting a bit more Computer Engineering education. We're moving away from them getting as much technical depth as 1st year computer engineers in hardware topics, so that's fine, but the words wouldn't be quite as accurate. I think the words I would believe most would be about FYDP and about the cohort system. It would definitely be more of a challenge to be convincing. We probably would still get enough students.

I think, by the way, that students would duck SE380, but I don't think the most academically inclined top 75% would duck CS 343. Sometimes I'm wrong about these things.

Derek, you've said previously that CS + DHW is a better SE degree than CS. We could move that way if we weren't accredited.

The last question is whether we'd need to remove "engineering" from the name.

To sum up, though, I kind of have a "why change it if it's not broken" attitude towards this question. We could probably make an unaccredited program work, but it's not at all clear that it would be long-term viable, and it's also not clear that it would help students, except that we can remove some NSEs. And we'd lose some things that are important to some students.

[I still want to write the SE retrospective, but writing papers and grants that are in my core research area keep on getting in the way; hopefully next month.]

I don't know how risk adverse Mary is, but probably the right approach to making changes at the CEAB level is to do what we think is best and then to argue about it once they say no. If they say no to cognitive psychology, then you have a specific thing to argue about and at that point you get the other Deans to back you up. It probably would be good for the Deans to all agree in advance that they will back each other up on the things they want to change, which is why this plan needs Mary on side.

Personally, I think theoretical computer science is math, especially these days. IMHO, the correct route is to advocate for more math and less NSE in the SE program, rather than trying to argue that math is actually NSE.

Subject: Re: should SE drop accreditation? --- asks the dean of engineering
 
Cognitive science: I am thrilled to report that the 2023 calendar that will be published in January/February will include cognitive psychology courses as natural science electives. That was surprisingly easy to do. I really thought it was going to be a huge fight, but it went through without almost any discussion at all. Management Engineering had already opened this door a crack. I got ECE to walk through it with us. So at least three programs have cognitive psychology courses as approved natural science electives. NSERC funds cognitive psychology research, so I feel confident that this will be ok at the next accreditation.

Bioinformatics: At Engineering's FOPS committee last Friday (which discusses but doesn't vote), there was general acceptance of the following as natural science electives --- with some discussion, in which I argued that one of the major ways in which biology happens these days is by applying engineering/computing ideas towards natural science. Also, at least BIOL382 here involves reading actual scientific research papers and trying to reproduce/extend the techniques.

    AMATH/BIOL382 Computational Modelling of Cellular Systems
    CS482 Computational Techniques in Biological Sequence Analysis
    PHYS468 Introduction to the Implementation of Quantum Information Processing

 
We have already let a few students take AMATH382 and PHYS468 on an experimental basis to learn more about the courses, and they really enjoyed them. It's pretty exciting for (at least some of) our students to be able to use their software skills to extend some published biology paper.

Hopefully we will be getting these bioinformatics courses (and more in this kind of area) in for the 2024 calendar. They might generate discussion at the next accreditation, but I'm hopeful that any qualified SE accreditation visitor will understand this.


Theoretical computer science: I would love to have this included in NSEs. Information theory too. This is a good thing to advocate to Engineers Canada for. I would love CS360 as an NSE. That would make the program better.

thanks!
Derek.

In my observation, over the last 5-6 years, this is a question that comes up ad hoc at SE Board meetings etc, and then it kind of peters out, but it's always a question that is asked and answered by people who are outside of the actual operations of the program. I'm glad to have clear direction from inside the program on this question. Thank you.

Besides the obvious unnecessary friction the process has, which affects all engineering programs. Sometimes I think that it would be nice if we could reduce NSE requirements in favour of something else. The distinction between "natural science" and "engineering science" is also a point of friction for some other engineering programs (e.g., chemical has said this to me recently).

>> Digital Hardware: I was quite surprised at the ECE department retreat this summer when I asked some digital hardware folks if they thought SE students should have a choice between control theory and computer architecture, and they said no, control theory all the way. (Besides which, ECE could not staff teaching the SE students more digital hardware as a required course.)  As Pat mentioned, I think more digital hardware might be good in the SE degree, but the ECE staffing situation has changed for the worse in this area over the last few years --- so, as Jim Barby sometimes says, we can ask this question again in 5-10 years.

>> I'm not sure if I misunderstood part of what Pat wrote below, but there is no change to the digital hardware content in the BSE degree. In particular, it's not reducing. What I am trying work with the SE CC on moving away from is so much overwhelming natural science in first year. This is a problem that Pat was also exploring during his directorship. Some things have changed in the external world since then (highschool math is weaker), and some other things have become clearer (many incoming students do not have the necessary math background for university physics). So the SE CC will look at swapping chemistry to 1A (like almost every other engineering program) and physics to 2A (after they have some university math skills).

Additionally, Patrick recently connected with Bilal Akhtar from SE2019 who told us that the latest Go programming language garbage collector is now based on a PI controller. We're trying to build up a set of these kinds of examples so that we can make these courses more obviously relevant to SE students.
