Accreditation is a big pain in the ass, as we all know. I agree with many of the other thoughts. Here's my calculations. I have no sentimental attachment to being accredited and if we could offer a good program without accreditation then we should.

1. Accreditation forces us to have stuff in our curriculum that we don't want. There is no natural champion for, in particular, the NSEs.
2. Students have a strong identification with "engineering undergraduate culture" (e.g. EngSoc) even if many students do end up switching to CS especially after first year. Being iron ring eligible is important to some subset of our students.
3. SE has a distinct identity from CS, in a much stronger way than the SE option. To expand on what I said above, I think the principal drivers of that are the cohort system and the iron ring.
4. I don't think actual curriculum content is that important to students, and I think it doesn't strongly affect what graduates are able to do 5 years down the road. My assumption is that a graduate can learn what they need to in terms of technical skills. Heresy alert: I'm skeptical that SE 463/464/465 contribute significantly to our students designing and writing better systems later on. On the other hand, the mandatory 3-course FYDP sequence does, I think, cause many students to stretch themselves in ways that they wouldn't otherwise. 

We do talk about ethics perhaps a bit more than CS students get, but I also wouldn't put a lot of money on graduates internalizing engineers' responsibility to society. Well, I'd put $1000 on it, but I wouldn't put half a year's salary on it.

OK, so what if we had a cohorted program which had no iron ring? What would I tell people at OUF? Well, I could say the words about SE 463/464/465, but I wouldn't. I could say words about ECE 124 and ECE 222 and getting a bit more Computer Engineering education. We're moving away from them getting as much technical depth as 1st year computer engineers in hardware topics, so that's fine, but the words wouldn't be quite as accurate. I think the words I would believe most would be about FYDP and about the cohort system. It would definitely be more of a challenge to be convincing. We probably would still get enough students.

I think, by the way, that students would duck SE380, but I don't think the most academically inclined top 75% would duck CS 343. Sometimes I'm wrong about these things.

Derek, you've said previously that CS + DHW is a better SE degree than CS. We could move that way if we weren't accredited.

The last question is whether we'd need to remove "engineering" from the name.

To sum up, though, I kind of have a "why change it if it's not broken" attitude towards this question. We could probably make an unaccredited program work, but it's not at all clear that it would be long-term viable, and it's also not clear that it would help students, except that we can remove some NSEs. And we'd lose some things that are important to some students.

[I still want to write the SE retrospective, but writing papers and grants that are in my core research area keep on getting in the way; hopefully next month.]
