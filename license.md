# Professional Engineering Licensure

In this section we discuss the narrow issue of licensure in the
Canadian context. Later on we will discuss software engineering as a
profession. We designed Waterloo's Software Engineering program to be
accreditable by both the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board as
well as the Computer Science Accreditation Council. We have abandoned
CS accreditation, as it requires significant effort and there is no
demand for it.

Engineering accreditation is a more fraught exercise; Memorial
University of Newfoundland was involved in a lawsuit in the 1990s
about its use of the name "software engineering" for a non-accredited
program and agreed to drop the name. Being an accredited engineering
program also imposes significant curriculum constraints, in particular
with respect to requirements for licensure of faculty and minimum
required amounts of natural science content.

In Canada, graduates from a CEAB-accredited engineering program may be
licensed as engineers (PEng) after they (1) have accumulated 4 years
of Canadian professional experience while supervised by a PEng and (2)
pass an examination on engineering law and ethics. Engineering
regulatory bodies take the position that only licensed engineers
should have job titles including the word "engineer", though
enforcement in the software domain is patchy.

In practice, we have observed that very few of our graduates pursue
licensure; Professional Engineers Ontario reported in May 2017 that only 7
Waterloo BSE graduates had been licensed. Our exit survey of 2018
graduates reported that 16\% of respondents intended to pursue
licensure. This is difficult in practice; the same survey showed that
only 33\% of our graduates intended to work in Canada, and many will
not be supervised by PEngs.

We broaden our focus slightly to our neighbour, the United States.  In
that country, close to zero software engineers sought licensure as
such; the software PE exam was taken by 81 candidates between 2013 and
2018, when it was discontinued. The American context is different,
most importantly in that "engineer" is not a protected title.

On the other hand, Canadian engineering graduates are eligible to
receive an iron ring, presented to them at the \emph{Ritual of the
Calling of an Engineer}. In our experience, almost all of our
graduates demonstrate that they identify with the engineering
profession by wearing the ring.

## Recent developments

The most recent public discussion of engineering licensure in Canada
occured in the province of Quebec. Different provinces have different
regulatory regimes. In 2019, the Quebec government proposed amendments
to its \emph{Code des Professions} which would have included
information technology to the regulated areas of practice for
engineers. The \emph{Coalition pour l'avenir de l'informatique}
(Coalition for the future of Computer Science), which included
industrial and academic computer science representatives, campaigned
for information technology to be excluded. The final version of the
law, passed in November 2020, indeed contained a specific exclusion for
computer science (specifically \emph{informatique} in the French).

Should software engineering be licensed? From a more personal context,
none of the authors of this work (all with academic teaching and
research roles) practices engineering based on the Ontario definition
of practice\footnote{Technically, in some
other Canadian jurisdictions (e.g. British Columbia), the teaching of
engineering counts as the practice of engineering.}, and none of us
has stamped a plan. 

Licensing of software engineers was a huge topic of debate in the late
1990s. Professional engineering organizations (particularly Texas)
were clamouring for software developers to be licensed. The software
engineering community was waiting for some catastrophic software error
to push the governments to require at least the licensing of software
engineers who develop safety critical systems.

Yet, when software errors cause planes to fall out of the sky, there
isn't a peep.

It seems safe to conclude that, on a global scale, licensing of
software engineers is dead.

## Bill Wilson on accreditation

Also, I have a comment on the issue of accreditation. From the very beginning the goal was to design and create a program that would fully integrate the Computer Engineering discipline and Computer Science discipline. To best achieve this goal the program was developed to be a “Truly Joint” program between the Department (School) of Computer Science in the Faculty of Math and the Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering. The program was jointly developed, implemented and operated by both academic units and the students belonged to both domains. The goal was that graduates from the program would be fully qualified as Computer Scientist AND as Computer Engineers. For this reason full accreditation was sought and successfully obtained in Computer Science and in Engineering. So seeking accreditation in both disciplines was not the direct goal for the program but is a consequence of the original goal of the program.

## Other Motivations for Engineering

- family with engineering (Bill Bishop?)
- cultures that value engineering 
- perception of being an "elite" program, due to smaller enrollment

- reiterate about iron ring
