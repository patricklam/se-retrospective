Surya Banarjee (Stats Lecturer who has most often taught STAT 206 to SE students) writes:

STAT 206 is one of my favourite courses to teach, and a requirement for SE students. It combines two distinct halves: Probability (the part that most students enjoy because it resembles most math courses in its deductive approach), and Statistical Inference (enjoyed less, possibly because (a) the material is rushed due to time constraints, and (b) the inductive nature of the subject). Both, however, are very useful in general.

I wish the historical issue of combining two statistics courses into one for the SE students, or at least to make it a 1.5 credit course.
