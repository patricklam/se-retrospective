This is a success in Canada, but I don't think we should contextualize it as a Canadian story. I think we should contextualize it as a story about software engineering as a discipline and profession.

From the 1960s through 2000 there was a lot of talk about the metaphor of "engineering" with regards to software. Other metaphors as well: the surgical team metaphor, the growing/agriculture metaphor, carpentry/craftsmanship metaphor, bricolage, etc. So what happened with all that?

- "software engineer" is now a dominant job title
- but they aren't licensed --- and nobody seems to care, although safety and security of critical public infrastructure is a growing concern ...
- is Facebook public infrastructure? because that's where our students go to work ... we didn't imagine exactly that kind of public infrastructure last century ...
- Boeing 737MAX, election machines, etc.

Are we teaching our students to engineer software in the way that Parnas and Brooks and Shaw and Jackson imagined last century? Is that what industry is hiring them to do? We could poll our students on these kinds of issues, and also look at the graduating class profiles. The SE2020 graduation profile had some data on what kind of work they are doing and what kind of work they would prefer to be doing.

I think the international venues would be better places to have this broader discussion about software engineering as a discipline and profession and industry, as seen through the lens of our educational program.

I would add the evolution in thinking about licensing of software engineers, which was a huge topic of debate in the late 1990s. Professional engineering organizations were clamouring for software developers to be licensed. We were waiting for some catastrophic software error to push the governments to require at least the licensing of software engineers who develop safety critical systems. 

Yet, when software errors cause planes to fall out of the sky, there isn’t a peep.

Licensing of software engineers is dead.

Licensing #1: we have a new datapoint on this from our educational experience. We teach in Ontario, but our students are largely employed outside of Ontario. Globalization is part of what has killed the prospect of licensing --- in addition to the licensing bodies being too slow to get in on SE (Pat found a great admission on that from the PEO annual report one year). Software is particularly global. Licensing on a per-province/state level isn't good enough --- but that's the way that things have been historically organized for the historical engineering disciplines.

Licensing #2: Geographical arbitrage. We are now getting our instructors licensed in BC because they understand software and academia better than PEO. CEAB is federal and needs to recognize all provincial licenses as equivalent. Just another sign of how the reality of globalization doesn't mesh well with the traditional licensing structure.

For licensing, yes, our students have voted with their feet and are not / cannot license because they are practicing in the US. However, if licensing was a thing for software in general, they might clamour to register as PE in the US, and they are obviously not doing that either.

Is licensing important in practicing software engineering? I say, and I don't think it's that hyperbolic, that our democracies are at risk from bad software. But there is a difference in degree between what a bad bridge engineer does and what a bad software system does. Responsibility is much, much more diffuse. (I could be wrong here; maybe we should discuss this.)

Even in the 737 MAX case, which one could say can be fairly narrowly attributed to software, it's not really. Here's a discussion:

What happens when a software engineer practices bad craft? Well, at a micro level, the system might be unavailable, or it might leak data, or it might compute the wrong results, or it might make the wrong thing easy to do.

Is it reasonable to think that a licensed software engineer would refuse to implement democracy-threatening features? What would a software engineer have done in the 737 MAX case?

At some level one could hope that the decision makers had an engineering education and keep ethical issues in mind.

But it doesn't seem like there is any appetite to mandate licensing for software engineers in society.

DR:
This talk announcement also reminds me that AI's (potential) impact on software engineering is something for us to consider in our educational context in this reflection:

Talk Title: A Tale of Two Applications of Verification in Machine Learning
Abstract: The rise of machine learning, particularly in the form of deep learning, has created a qualitative shift in our conception of what software is and what software can accomplish. But, of course, it’s not all rainbows and butterflies. Researchers have been hard at work trying to understand the fragility of the machine-learning pipeline: from training to inference, small changes to the input can result in radical changes to the output, which can lead to security, safety, as well as ethical problems. In this talk, I will show how new techniques from software verification can help us reason about, and ensure, robustness of machine-learning techniques against training-time (poisoning) and test-time (adversarial-example) attacks. This talk is based on joint work with Yuhao Zhang, Samuel Drews, and Loris D’Antoni.
