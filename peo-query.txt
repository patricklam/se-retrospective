Hi,

As past Director of the Software Engineering program at the University of Waterloo, I am writing a 20-year retrospective of our program. It would be very helpful to know how many PEngs in Ontario are currently registered in the Software discipline, as well as how many people were granted new PEng licenses in 2020 with the Software discipline. I would also need, as context, the total number of registered PEngs as well as new PEngs.

Thank you very much!

Patrick Lam
