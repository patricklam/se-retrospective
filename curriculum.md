# Curricular Evolution

As educators, we care a lot about the curriculum. However, many
factors are more important to what students learn than the precise
contents of the curriculum. Nevertheless, we discuss the curriculum
here and extra-curricular concerns in Section~\ref{other}.

Waterloo's Software Engineering program was designed in the 1990s,
while the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the IEEE
Computer Society were attempting to establish software engineering as
a profession through their joint Software Engineering Coordinating
Committee (SWECC); ACM Council distanced itself from SWECC in 2000 and
dis-endorsed licensure of SE as a profession.

As discussed in Section~\ref{history}, in the Canadian context, it appears
that programs with ``engineering'' in the name need to be accreditable by the
Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board.

## Original Curriculum

[what do we want to say about the original curriculum?]

To summarize the October 1999 proposal, the original curriculum
contained mathematics (6 courses), natural science (2 courses), CS
content, ECE content, and SE content. % write more

The SE core included the SE core from the SE option as well as
6 other specified courses: software project management, concurrency,
system performance evaluation, networks, operating systems, and
databases.

Let's talk about the SE core. SE degree programs, including UW, were
created out of an understanding of what SE was up to the 1990s.
A full discussion of the changes in software engineering practice
since then is well beyond the scope of this paper. 

We reiterate from earlier work some important design considerations in
our context: we aimed for a 50/50 balance between ECE and CS in terms
of the teaching load for SE, and we re-used existing courses when
possible. In the past 20 years, we have eventually created some
SE-specific courses, but this was only done mindfully, and with strong
support from stakeholders.

## Current State

In the Waterloo context, the BSE program can be thought of as a
constrained version of the Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS) curriculum
which additionally requires students to take core Software Engineering
courses as well as meet engineering accreditation requirements. This
results in a program that includes 3.5 more courses than a BCS---43.5 versus 40
over 8 academic semesters.

At the moment, the BSE meets all technical (CS/math) course
requirements for the BCS except that the BCS requires two statistics
courses while the BSE requires one. Interestingly, at the time of the
BSE's creation, CE also required zero statistics and now requires two
courses as well. Additionally, the BSE includes circuits and computer
hardware courses from ECE as taken by Computer Engineering students in
their first three terms. The BSE also requires fewer humanities/social
sciences courses and does not require a so-called depth chain, three
courses that are linked by prerequisites.

So, what does the BSE include? In terms of core CS, it includes
standard CS 1 and CS 2 courses in first year; SE teaches them in C/C++
rather than Racket/C as for BCS students. It also includes the
5-course second-year CS core (how compilation works; data structures;
logic and computation; software engineering principles) as well as
third-year algorithms. Non-core CS courses that are required for SE
include user interfaces, concurrency, and databases.

Software Engineering is unique among the set \{CS, SE, CE\} in that it
requires applicants to present proof of programming experience prior
to admission. The implication for SE is that CS 1 doesn't teach
introductory programming concepts, but does teach how these concepts
are realized in C.

Software engineering courses now include the three-course sequence in
requirements, design, and testing. Other courses are feedback control and
a three-course design project sequence. In first year, there is a
half-credit course introducing students to the engineering profession as well as
including a small open-ended project.

## Changes

Over the past 20 years, the SE core has evolved. We highlight
important changes below.

### SE core

The original design of the three-course SE sequence included a project
which consisted of developing software for a Private Branch Exchange
(PBX) system. This project became defunct by 2008; over the same
interval, Software Engineering aligned with all other Waterloo
Engineering programs in including an open-ended capstone project,
discussed below. In SE's case, this project spans three semesters.

We have removed a number of the original Software Engineering courses,
in particular Software Project Management.

% get some context from previous directors here, this predates me. The course was taught in 2008.

% I think SE 457 doesn't exist anymore because the instructor retired.

We have changed the order of the three-course sequence to start in third year
and with testing, progressing to design and then requirements. As industry goes,
this sequence now reflects more agile methodologies.

% somewhere we should talk about requirements, and also about architecture. That somewhere is probably a "discussion" part of this section.

We moved databases from third year to second year. Many students had already
seen a substantial amount of database content through co-op jobs and were
finding that our databases course was too late in the curriculum.

The three-course SE sequence had started with courses that mirrored
the CS/ECE versions of these courses. Over time, these courses have
diverged.

The design course for CS students includes a substantial project,
which is not appropriate for SE students also doing their capstone
design project.  Another point of contention among SE students is
overlap between the second year software engineering course and the
design course; students feel like they learn design patterns too many
times. The design course is also supposed to be about software
architectures.

The non-SE version of the course on software testing, quality
assurance, and maintenance has also diverged as it has been taught by
a more formal methods-focussed faculty member.

### Capstone Project

For the past 10 years, the capstone project has been a key part of the
Software Engineering curriculum. Our goal has been that students
create something that they are proud of. Perhaps the key difficulty is
that this is the first significant time where our students, who are
quite used to meeting requirements, are given a green-field task and
not told what to do.
