# Curricular Evolution

As educators, we care a lot about the curriculum. However,
many factors are likely to be more important to what students
learn than the precise contents of the curriculum. Nevertheless, we discuss
the curriculum here and extra-curricular concerns in Section~\ref{other}.

Waterloo's Software Engineering program was designed in the 1990s,
while the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the IEEE
Computer Society were attempting to establish software engineering as
a profession through their joint Software Engineering Coordinating
Committee (SWECC). In 1999--2000, as the SE program was being approved
and mounted in its initial form, ACM Council withdrew from SWECC and
took a position against licensure for software engineers.

As discussed in Section~\ref{history}, in the Canadian context, it appears
that programs with ``engineering'' in the name need to be accreditable by the
Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board.

## Original Curriculum

[what do we want to say about the original curriculum?]

To summarize the October 1999 proposal, the original curriculum
contained mathematics (6 courses), natural science (2 courses), CS
content, ECE content, and SE content. % write more

The SE core included the SE core from the SE option as well as
6 other specified courses: software project management, concurrency,
system performance evaluation, networks, operating systems, and
databases.

Let's talk about the SE core. SE degree programs, including UW, were
created out of an understanding of what SE was up to the 1990s.

- Has SE changed since then? What has happened?
    - metaphors of engineering, etc.
    - industry
    - education
    - profession / licensing
        - often regional
        - industry is global

* 50/50 ECE/CS balance
* sharing already-existing courses

## Current State

In the Waterloo context, the BSE program can be thought of as a constrained version of the Bachelor of Computer Science curriculum which requires students to take core Software Engineering courses as well as meet engineering accreditation requirements. This results in a program that includes 3.5 more courses than a BCS.

At the moment, the BSE meets all technical (CS/math) course requirements for the BCS except that the BCS requires two statistics courses while the BSE requires one. Interestingly, at the time of the BSE's creation, CE also required zero statistics and now requires two courses as well. The BSE also requires fewer humanities/social sciences courses and does not require a so-called depth chain, three courses that are linked by prerequisites.

So, what does the BSE include? In terms of core CS, it includes
standard CS 1 and CS 2 courses in first year; SE teaches them in C/C++
rather than Racket/C as for BCS students. It also includes the
5-course second-year CS core [description] as well as third-year
algorithms. Non-core CS courses that are required for SE include user
interfaces, concurrency, and databases.

Software Engineering is unique among the set \{CS, SE, CE\} in that it requires applicants to present proof of programming experience. The implication is that CS 1 doesn't teach introductory programming concepts, but does teach how these concepts are realized in C.

Computer engineering courses include two courses in circuits and an introductory
architecture course.

Software engineering courses now include the three-course sequence in
requirements, design, and testing. Other courses are feedback control and
a three-course design project sequence. In first year, there is a
half-credit course introducing students to the engineering profession as well as
including a small open-ended project.

## Changes to Core

### SE 123 / project

The original design of the three-course SE sequence included a project
which consisted of developing software for a Private Branch Exchange
(PBX) system. This project became defunct by 2008; over the same interval,
Software Engineering aligned with all other Waterloo Engineering programs in
including an open-ended capstone project. In SE's case, this project spans
three semesters.

We have changed the order of the three-course sequence to start in third year
and with testing, progressing to design and then requirements. As industry goes,
this sequence now reflects more agile methodologies.

(students essentially never choose SE to do the three-course sequence)

We moved databases from third year to second year. Many students had already
seen a substantial amount of database content through co-op jobs and were
finding that our databases course was too late in the curriculum.

The three-course SE sequence had started with courses that mirrored
the CS/ECE versions of these courses. Over time, these courses have
diverged.

The design course for CS students includes a substantial
project, which is not appropriate for SE students also doing their
capstone design project.  Another point of contention is overlap
between the second year software engineering course and the design
course; students feel like they learn design patterns too many
times. The design course is also supposed to be about software
architectures.

The non-SE version of the course on software testing, quality
assurance, and maintenance has also diverged as it has been taught by
a more formal methods-focussed faculty member.
