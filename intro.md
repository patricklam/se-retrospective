# Introduction

In this paper we want to discuss lessons that we have learned from 20 years of running the successful
Software Engineering undergraduate program at the University of Waterloo. Obviously curriculum evolution
is important. But we will first talk about meta-curricular issues: student support, governance,
collaboration, coop, and accreditation.
