# Introduction

In this paper, we discuss lessons that we have learned from 20 years
of running the successful Software Engineering undergraduate program
at the University of Waterloo. Our focus reaches beyond the curriculum
to include critical elements in program success, specifically
including co-operative education, community-building, student support,
and governance. We revisit our program design decisions and judge them
with the benefit of our experience. We hope that this paper is useful
to others contemplating new programs or seeking to improve existing
programs.
