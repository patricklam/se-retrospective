# Success

Our perception is that Waterloo's Software Engineering program is a successful one.
But what does it mean for a program to be successful? We propose some components
(and, when appropriate, metrics) that contribute to a program's success.

Before:
* reputation among academic colleagues, applicants, parents, employers
* number of applications

During:
* high retention (BSE, BCS)
* morale and community spirit (students helping students)
* co-op employment rates

After:
* student satisfaction
* post-graduation employment rates
* number of alumni going to graduate school
